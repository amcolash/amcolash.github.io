{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"IoTBuddy","slug":"iotbuddy","content":"<p>For a gift, I had recieved an internet enabled outlet strip. Not knowing quite what to do with it, I decided to make a simple application for my Pebble Time smartwatch. This smartwatch app then interfaced with the popular web service <a href='http://ifttt.com'>IFTTT</a>. This service lets you link different other web services, such as Twitter, Facebook, Gmail or in my case a smart outlet strip together. IoTBuddy allows users to trigger an IFTTT event from anywhere in the world without needing to use a phone or web browser.</p>\n","links":[{"_target":null,"title":"Github","url":"https://github.com/amcolash/IoT-Buddy"},{"_target":null,"title":"Pebble App Store","url":"https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/568f550d05f633c62800003d"}],"images":["/assets/img/projects/IoTBuddy.png"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
