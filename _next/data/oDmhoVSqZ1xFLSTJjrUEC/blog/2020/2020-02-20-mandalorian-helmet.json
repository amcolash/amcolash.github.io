I spent more than a few weekends and evenings working on my newest project - making a Mandalorian helmet out of EVA foam. I have enjoyed watching others on YouTube make cosplay props for years now, including Adam Savage on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/testedcom\">Tested</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/punishedprops\">Punished Props Academy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Mogrymillian\">Kamui Cosplay</a> - just to name a few. Until now, I had never really gotten involved in making cosplay/prop making and this was all entirely new territory - as I have much more of a background in electronics and software. I had recently gotten a rotary (Dremel) tool for a present, so working on this project was a perfect way to try it out. When I saw that Punished Props had given out a <a href=\"https://www.punishedprops.com/2019/11/11/foam-mandos/\">free pattern</a> for making this helmet, I went for it!</p>\n<h2>Getting Supplies</h2>\n<p>There were so many tools and materials I had never used in this build. To keep it simple, check out the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BSuEIMpj_S4\">video</a> from Punished Props for a better idea of what Bill used in his version. I decided to go 1:1 and tried to get as many similar materials as possible so that I was able to try out all the parts of the process. I got a whole bunch of tools/paints/materials from a local art shop, hardware store and amazon for the harder to find items.</p>\n<h2>Making the Helmet</h2>\n<p>For the sake of brevity, I won't go through every small detail of the build, but will give a bit of an overview of what I ended up doing. The video above has a much better description of all of the work involved. Here is quick list of what I ended up doing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Print/cut/trace patterns onto EVA foam\n<ul>\n<li>Figure out how to make a DIY router for cutting 45 degree pieces</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Connect pieces of foam with contact cement</li>\n<li>Smooth seams and hard edges with rotary tool</li>\n<li>Fill seams and bumpy sections with caulk, sand after dried</li>\n<li>With a lot of patience, repeat 3x:\n<ul>\n<li>Prime helmet</li>\n<li>Coat in epoxy and sand down</li>\n<li>Fill bumps and smooth with automotive body filler</li>\n<li>Sand things down</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Put on a base coat of black acrylic paint</li>\n<li>Dry brush on a silver acrylic paint to start making it look more metallic</li>\n<li>Rub graphite powder (normally used as a dry lubricant) on the entire helmet to really make it look metallic</li>\n<li>Learn how to use an airbrush... then</li>\n<li>Airbrush 2 coats of lacquer to protect the graphite powder</li>\n<li>Airbrush on the Mandalorian Crest onto the top</li>\n<li>Airbrush on green highlights to the front cheek portion of the helmet</li>\n<li>Apply weathering to the entire helmet using oil paints as well as airbrushing some dark tones to certain parts of the helmet</li>\n<li>2x application of a gloss top coat</li>\n<li>Add foam pads inside helmet for comfort and fitting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wrapping Things Up</h2>\n<p>Wow, that was a lot more work than I realized now that I write it down! It was a ton of fun to work with EVA - an incredibly versatile material. I learned so much in the process, including how to use a rotary tool, use an airbrush, numerous painting techniques, sanding is REALLY boring but incredibly important - to name just a few. My favorite part was definitely the airbrush - it was such a different way to paint and I loved how smooth of a coat of paint could be applied compared to a normal brush.</p>\n<p>I have added a final video as well as a ton of pictures below to take a look at the process, enjoy!</p>\n","images":[{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200106_172702.jpg","alt":"Starting Materials (Before I got more tools)"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200108_194404.jpg","alt":"Patterns on Foam"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200112_154531.jpg","alt":"DIY Router"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200112_154256.jpg","alt":"\"Routed\" Foam Pieces (45° cuts)"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200117_212336_904.jpg","alt":"Helmet Assembly"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200118_211230.jpg","alt":"Back Detail Panel"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200118_215456.jpg","alt":"Back Strip and Sanded Caulk"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200118_215500.jpg","alt":"Side Details"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200118_215507.jpg","alt":"Front of Helmet after Caulk"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200121_195217.jpg","alt":"Fixing Details on Helmet Strip"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200121_195225.jpg","alt":"Drying Mechanism"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200121_211956.jpg","alt":"First Coat of Primer"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200126_115317.jpg","alt":"Filling with Automotive Body Putty"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200125_013352.jpg","alt":"Epoxy Coat #2"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200129_094017.jpg","alt":"Lots of Sanding Later..."},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200211_000210.jpg","alt":"Base Black Acrylic Coat"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200211_181722.jpg","alt":"Metallic Silver Acrylic  Dry Brush"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200211_235933.jpg","alt":"Rubbing in Graphite Powder"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200211_234426.jpg","alt":"After Graphite Powder"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200219_190441.jpg","alt":"Getting the New Airbrush Set Up"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200215_202636.jpg","alt":"Mandalorian Crest from Airbrush Stencil"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200215_194805.jpg","alt":"Back of Helmet with Weathering"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200215_194753.jpg","alt":"Green Highlights on Front"},{"_target":null,"url":"/assets/img/blog/2020/mandalorian-helmet/IMG_20200218_225737.jpg","alt":"Final Helmet!"}],"video":"4piuQQDu9xY"}},"__N_SSG":true}
