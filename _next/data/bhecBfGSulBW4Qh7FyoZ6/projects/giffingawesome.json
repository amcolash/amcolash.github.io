{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"GiffingAwesome","slug":"giffingawesome","content":"<p>GiffingAwesome is a simple site that allows you to keep track of your favorite GIF images. I personally love to share these animated images with friends, but it was more difficult than necessary to save and share from a library of my favorites. I had to either locally save all of the files, or keep a list of links. GiffingAwesome was a simple idea that turned into much more. I was interested in learning about the service Firebase for my next side project. I was particularly interested in catching up on my Angular skills (the last time I had used it was in 2014). The project taught me about not only Angular but also about the Ionic and Corvoda frameworks which were the stars of this project.</p>\n","links":[{"_target":null,"title":"Github","url":"https://github.com/amcolash/GiffingAwesome"},{"_target":null,"title":"Live Site","url":"https://giffingawesome.firebaseapp.com"}],"images":["/assets/img/projects/GiffingAwesome.jpg"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
