In the spring of 2015, I signed up to take part in UW Madison's first ever hackathon entitled MadHacks. This hackathon was very open and had many different types of possibilities available. Since Pebble was a sponsor at the event and had some staff on hand, our group decided to make a Pebble watch application that could control Spotify and display album artwork on your wrist from another device. This app, while not polished and not completely finished was a proof of concept and helped to open the road for me to continue developing other Pebble app projects. Our group won the "Best Pebble Hack" award, which made the experience even more rewarding!
