What's Up is a project that was developed association with a colleague of mine. We wanted to build a social platform to see upcoming events happening in your area. It allows you to view events from Facebook, EventBrite and Meetup in your nearby area as well as creating your own custom events. The code was written with Ionic/Angular, uses the Google Maps API and has a FireBase backend (which helps with location queries and custom events).
